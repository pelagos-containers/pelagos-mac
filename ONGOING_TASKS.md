## Current State

**Phase 2 + Phase 3 VM Access COMPLETE.** The full container lifecycle and all three
VM access modes work end-to-end on real hardware. All 18 e2e tests pass (`bash scripts/test-e2e.sh`).

### What works today

| Feature | Status | Merged |
|---|---|---|
| VM boot via AVF | ✅ | Phase 0 |
| vsock round-trip (ping/pong) | ✅ | Phase 0 |
| `pelagos run` (pull + exec) | ✅ | PR #18 |
| Persistent daemon (warm reuse) | ✅ | PR #27 |
| virtiofs bind mounts (`-v`) | ✅ | PR #28 |
| `pelagos exec` (piped + PTY) | ✅ | PR #38 |
| `pelagos ps / logs / stop / rm` | ✅ | PR #37 |
| `pelagos run --detach --name` | ✅ | PR #37 |
| `pelagos vm shell` | ✅ | PR #45 |
| Busybox applet symlinks in VM | ✅ | PR #47 |
| Persistent OCI image cache (`/dev/vda` ext2) | ✅ | PR #50 |
| ECR Public test image (no rate limits) | ✅ | PR #50 |
| devpts mount + PTY job control | ✅ | PR #38/#40 |
| `pelagos vm console` (hvc0 serial) | ✅ | PR #51 |
| `pelagos vm ssh` (dropbear + ed25519 key) | ✅ | PR #52 |

## Phase 3 — VM Access (Epic #41) ✅ COMPLETE

All three options for direct VM access are done (closed in PR #51, PR #52):

### Option A — `pelagos vm shell` (vsock) ✅ DONE (PR #45)

Interactive `/bin/sh` inside the VM over vsock. No container namespaces.
TTY and non-TTY modes both work.

### Option B — `pelagos vm console` (hvc0) ✅ DONE (PR #51)

Attaches to the VM's hvc0 serial console. Raw boot output visible; root shell
auto-spawns on hvc0. Ctrl-] detaches. Non-TTY/pipe mode with 2s drain for scripting.

### Option C — `pelagos vm ssh` (dropbear) ✅ DONE (PR #52)

Runs `dropbear` sshd in the VM. Key pair generated at `~/.local/share/pelagos/vm_key`
during `make image`; public key baked into initramfs as `root`'s `authorized_keys`.
`pelagos vm ssh [-- cmd args]` connects to `root@192.168.105.2` using the stored key.

---

## Phase 3 — NAT Reliability (issue #26) ✅ COMPLETE

socket_vmnet migration done (merged, branch `feat/socket-vmnet`).
VM gets a stable `192.168.105.2` IP via DHCP (socket_vmnet shared mode) or
static fallback. `pelagos vm ssh` depends on this stable IP.

---

## Phase 4 — VS Code Dev Container support (Epic #55)

Goal: make pelagos-mac a backend for the [devcontainer CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli).

| Subtask | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Docker CLI shim (`pelagos-docker`) | #56 | Not started |
| Native port forwarding (`-p host:container`) | #57 | Not started |
| glibc/Ubuntu container image compatibility | #58 | Not started |

**Recommended start: #57 (port forwarding).**
It is self-contained Rust, has no external dependencies, and unblocks both the
Docker CLI shim and SSH-based workflows. Once ports work, the shim (#56) can
expose them correctly in `inspect` output, and glibc testing (#58) becomes more
meaningful (containers can open network listeners that are actually reachable).

See `docs/VM_LIFECYCLE.md` for the VM networking topology (socket_vmnet,
192.168.105.x subnet) that port forwarding builds on.

## Phase 4 — Signed Installer (not yet tracked)

`.pkg` installer for distribution. Requires:
- Developer ID Application signature + notarization
- Hardened runtime entitlement
- `com.apple.security.virtualization` in the signed entitlements
